# Builder Design Pattern
This design pattern allows us to construct objects step by step, specifying only the attributes we need especially in cases where complex objects with numerous optional parameters are required.

- The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step.
- It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step fashion, where the construction process can vary based on the type of product being built.
- The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
